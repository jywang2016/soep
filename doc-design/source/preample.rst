Purpose of the Document
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This document describes the software requirements
and implementation of the Spawn of EnergyPlus (SOEP).
As of October 2016, the main requirements pertain to the software
implementation and mathematical capabilities.
Requirements for the physical and control models will be added later.

The document is a working document that is used as a discussion basis
and will evolve as the development progresses. The proposed design
should not be considered finalized.
